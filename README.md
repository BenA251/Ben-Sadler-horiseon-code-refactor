# horiseon-code-refactor

## Description 

This Code refactor project involved making improvements to existing HTML and CSS file without altering what the website does to improve accessibility, This project is first week challenge of EdX Bootcamp in front end web development course. 

The project User Story & acceptance criteria are as follows:

<ins>User Story </ins> <br><br>
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

<ins>The acceptance criteria </ins> <br>
* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

In addition to doing the above I also made HTML and CSS more concise by indentifying instances of redunancy that is where code is repeated multiple times in several classes and consolidating these into just one class.

I have used annotation within both HTML and CSS file to identify where changes made and why. These files are available in the same repository.
